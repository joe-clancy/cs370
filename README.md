Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I was given code to create the sample environment and establish the rules that the intelligent agent needed to adhere to. I implemented a Q-learning algorithm to train the intelligent agent to solve the pathfinding problem and enable the pirate NPC to find its way to the treasure at the end of the maze.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing and developing systems that effect essentially every aspect of modern life. Computer scientists contribute to essentially every modern field, including healthcare, transportation, manufacturing, and many more. The modern economy, and modern society in general, would be essentially impossible without the work of computer scientists.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I start by defining the problem clearly and understanding its context, scope, and requirements. I then analyze the problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable parts and identifying potential solutions.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization include:

  -Transparency regarding data collection and user privacy.
  
  -Safeguarding sensitive information for both the organization and the end user.
  
  -Ensuring that algorithms or systems I develop are fair and unbiased.
  
  -Ensuring that algorithms or systems I develop adhere to applicable legal regulations.
